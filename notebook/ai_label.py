Classify each of the following paragraphs using these labels:

A financial highlight should be labeled 1. A financial highlight is often a statistic about how the company is doing.
Common examples are revenue, EBITDA, year over year, etc. Keep it to these types of stats that a casual investor can
view and quickly see how the company is doing. 

Risks should be labeled 2. Risks are potential dangers that will affect the company businesses. Do not label it a risk
unless it explicitly talks about a risk that will impact the company's reputation or revenue or impact.

Products should be labeled 3. Products are simply what the company has been working on in the past year. These paragraphs
should be specifically about certain products, ie. Google has youtube and Meta has instagram. do not something as product
if it is unclear. 

AI should be labeled 4. Make sure it is talking about AI, or an LLM, or something of the sort. do not just quote intelligence
and label that as AI.

Everything else should be labeled as 0, as that is not relevant to our user to read. Most paragraphs should be 0 unless they clearly fit one of the other categories.

Return your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas, in order.
Example: 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0

Paragraphs:
